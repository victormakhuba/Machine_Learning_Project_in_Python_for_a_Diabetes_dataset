# Machine Learning Project in Python for a Diabetes dataset
The goal I had for this project was to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health-related features.
The dataset contains 768 samples (rows) and 9 features (columns), including:
1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose
3. BloodPressure
4. SkinThickness
5. Insulin
6. BMI
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction
8. Age
9. Outcome - Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)

I first explored the data so that I could understand what libraries I would need to help me come up with outcomes/predictionsm for the projects
